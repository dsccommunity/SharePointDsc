.DESCRIPTION
 This example shows how to remove a specific app management service application in the
 local SharePoint farm. The application pool property is still mandatory but it is not
 used so therefore the value is not important.

Configuration Example
{
    param
    (
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [PSCredential]
        $SetupAccount
    )

    Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

    node localhost
    {
        SPAppManagementServiceApp AppManagementServiceApp
        {
            Name                 = "App Management Service Application"
            ApplicationPool      = "n/a"
            Ensure               = "Absent"
            PsDscRunAsCredential = $SetupAccount
        }
    }
}
