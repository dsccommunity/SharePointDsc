.DESCRIPTION
 This example shows how to remove a project server service app in the local farm.
 The ApplicationPool property is still required but is not used when removing, so
 the value used here doesn't matter.

Configuration Example
{
    param
    (
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [PSCredential]
        $SetupAccount
    )

    Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

    node localhost
    {
        SPProjectServerServiceApp ProjectServiceApp
        {
            Name                 = "Project Server Service Application"
            ApplicationPool      = "n/a"
            Ensure               = "Absent"
            PsDscRunAsCredential = $SetupAccount
        }
    }
}
