<!-- AutoSPInstaller Sample Configuration File
    General Instructions:
    1. If you use the characters ' " < > & in your configuration (e.g. in passwords) you should encode them as follows:

        ' &apos;
        " &quot;
        < &lt;
        > &gt;
        & &amp;
    
        For example <Password>Fd"je&f</Password> should be written <Password>Fd&quot;je&amp;f</Password>
    2. Configuration IS case sensitive.
    3. Use a validator like http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_validator.asp to check the syntax of your file.
    4. Any element that has a Provision="" attribute controls whether a particular component, site, or service is installed
       on a particular server. It can be set to either true to provision on every server on which the script is run,
       false to never provision, or to a list of computer names to provision the service only on the listed machines.
       This allows you to configure an entire multi-server farm with different servers fulfilling different roles
       using a single configuration file.
       e.g. <ExcelServices Provision="Server1 Server2"> would provision excel services only on Server1 and Server2. -->
<!-- The Environment attribute below appears at the top of the installation transcript, and will now also appear at the top of the SharePoint 2013+ Central Administration top-left branding bar. It does not affect the SharePoint 2010 installation though.
     Simply leave the Environment attribute blank if you do not want to alter the branding bar in SP2013+ Central Admin.
     The Version attribute is now used for comparing the XML schema version with the version of the script (specifically, AutoSPInstallerFunctions.ps1), as there may be dependencies between XML and script elements. -->

         Allowed values are "2010", "2013" or "2016". If you omit this, the script will attempt to determine the version anyhow, and default to 2013 if multiple sets of install files are present. -->

             Again, this is ONLY required if you did not specify a dedicated MySite host web application earlier in the XML. Make sure the MySiteManagedPath is valid and exists or was specified earlier in the XML as part of the corresponding web app.
             EXAMPLE: If you wanted your MySite host to reside at http://sharepoint.contoso.com/people and personal sites to be created at http://sharepoint.contoso.com/people/sites, you would specify MySiteHostLocation="http://sharepoint.contoso.com/people" and MySiteManagedPath="people/sites"

             NOTE: If this is set to "true" in a multi-server farm, the first server that gets the User Profile Service installed on it will also have Profile Sync provisioned on it.
             If you are running SP2010 SP1, you can set CreateDefaultSyncConnection to true and specify the SyncConnectionAccount credentials; 
             the script will attempt to create a default Sync connection using the new (although unsupported) Add-SPProfileSyncConnection cmdlet.
             NOTE: Add-SPProfileSyncConnection may be useful for experimental/non-production builds but as per http://www.harbar.net/archive/2011/07/12/332.aspx it's UNSUPPORTED in on-premises deployments -->
